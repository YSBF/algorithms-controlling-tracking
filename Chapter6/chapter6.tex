\section*{Summary}

This chapter introduces the reader to the software architecture running off board on Linux. The introduction presents a  general overview on software architectures, expressed the needs of such a system and in particular it describes the environment and software tools involved. Next section presents the design pattern according to which the sofware is organized explaining its advantages and limitations. Then the software components are described with more detail one by one and the results of the experiments are reported.
